## 🎨 User Experience Design

### 1. CLI Experience Flow
```bash
# User starts with complex architecture question
$ monk --stack=development "How should I design a real-time chat system for 1M users?"

🧠 MONK - Analyzing with Development Stack...
👤 Selected Agent: Architect (High confidence: 94%)
🔍 Checking memory for similar architecture patterns...
💡 Found 3 relevant patterns from your previous work

🏗️  **System Architecture Recommendation**

Based on your previous Redis scaling success and WebSocket expertise:

1. **Load Balancer Tier**: Nginx + HAProxy (you had great results with this setup)
2. **Application Tier**: Node.js cluster (matches your team's expertise) 
3. **Real-time Layer**: Socket.io with Redis adapter (builds on your Redis knowledge)
4. **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL + Redis (consistent with your stack preferences)
5. **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka (new suggestion based on latest research)

📊 **Performance Estimates** (based on your previous optimizations):
- Handle 1M concurrent connections
- <50ms message delivery (your latency target from chat project)
- 99.9% uptime (meets your reliability requirements)

🎯 **Next Steps**:
1. Run: `monk --agent=integration_specialist "Design the deployment strategy"`  
2. Run: `monk --memory-guided "Show me monitoring setup from previous projects"`

## 🎯 User Acceptance Criteria

### For Senior/Staff Engineers
```gherkin
Scenario: Complex system architecture design
  Given I'm a senior engineer working on microservices architecture
  When I ask "Design a real-time notification system for 10M users"
  Then the Architect agent should be auto-selected
  And the response should reference my previous scaling solutions
  And the system should provide specific technology recommendations
  And the response time should be under 3 seconds
  And the recommendation should be stored in memory for future reference

Scenario: Cross-interface workflow
  Given I start a code review task in CLI
  When I switch to VS Code
  Then my session state should be automatically synchronized
  And the VS Code extension should show the active review context
  And I should be able to continue the task seamlessly
```

### For Full-Stack Developers
```gherkin
Scenario: Multi-domain development assistance
  Given I'm working on a full-stack application
  When I ask for help with both frontend React and backend Node.js issues
  Then the system should coordinate multiple agents appropriately
  And provide integrated solutions considering both domains
  And remember my technology stack preferences
  And suggest optimizations based on my previous projects

Scenario: Memory-guided development
  Given I solved a similar authentication issue 2 months ago  
  When I encounter a new authentication challenge
  Then the memory system should surface my previous solution
  And adapt the solution to the current context
  And explain what patterns are being reused
```

### For AI/ML Engineers
```gherkin
Scenario: Agent development workflow
  Given I'm developing my own AI agents
  When I ask for help with agent orchestration patterns
  Then the Innovation Driver agent should provide cutting-edge approaches
  And reference latest research in multi-agent systems
  And suggest implementation patterns specific to my framework
  And provide code examples compatible with my setup
```
