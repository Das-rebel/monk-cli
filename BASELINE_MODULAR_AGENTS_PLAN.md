# Baseline Modular Agents Plan
*Stored as reference for advanced research direction*

## Status: Baseline Reference Plan
This document contains the initial modular agent architecture plan that serves as the foundation for advanced research into:
- Multi-tool use capabilities
- Agent personality systems  
- Task-specific reward mechanisms
- Long-term memory for stack-specific expertise
- Advanced modular agent stacks

## Plan Summary
The baseline plan establishes:
1. **Modular Agent Framework** - Base architecture for composable agents
2. **Need-Based Discovery** - Dynamic agent creation based on usage patterns
3. **Community Marketplace** - Plugin architecture for shared skill modules
4. **Agent Composition Engine** - Multi-agent collaboration framework
5. **Example Stacks** - Content Creation, Business Intelligence, Development, Marketing

## Next Research Direction
Building upon this foundation, the next phase focuses on:
- **Android-style agent personalities** for consistent behavior patterns
- **Task-specific reward systems** that adapt to stack requirements
- **Long-term memory systems** that develop stack-specific expertise over time
- **Multi-tool orchestration** within modular agent stacks
- **Stack-specific memory storage** for specialized knowledge accumulation
