# Smart-AI CLI Phase 3 Enhancement - PRD
# Claude-Style Command Interface & Advanced Interaction

## Product Overview

Transform the current smart-ai CLI from a basic command-line tool into a sophisticated Claude Code-style intelligent assistant with context awareness, slash commands, conversation memory, and rich interaction patterns.

## Problem Statement

Current smart-ai CLI limitations:
- Generic responses lacking context awareness ("Please provide more context!")
- No slash command support (missing /help, /clear, /settings like Claude)
- Poor conversation flow - each interaction feels disconnected
- Limited command discovery - users don't know what's available
- Basic CLI parsing vs Claude's intelligent command interpretation
- No memory/session management across conversations
- Missing file awareness and project context
- No intelligent routing to best AI provider for task type

## Success Metrics

- 90% of responses use relevant project context
- <2 seconds response time for typical queries
- 95% accuracy in project type detection
- 85% user satisfaction with AI responses
- <500ms startup time including context loading

## Feature Requirements

### Phase 3A: Core Infrastructure

**1. Conversation Manager**
- Maintain conversation context and memory across sessions
- Store last 10 conversation turns with persistence
- Load project context automatically on startup
- Provide context to AI providers for informed responses
- Support context window management for large conversations

**2. Slash Command Processor**
- Implement Claude-style slash commands with full parser
- Support /help, /clear, /settings, /workspace, /analyze commands
- Add /providers, /history, /save, /load for session management
- Enable command aliases and shortcuts
- Provide command help and usage information

**3. Intelligent Router**
- Analyze query type and route to optimal AI provider
- Code questions → TreeQuest/Claude Code
- General knowledge → Gemma/GPT  
- File operations → Local processing + Claude
- Complex analysis → Claude with full context
- Implement fallback chains for provider failures

### Phase 3B: Command Interface  

**4. Natural Language Command Parser**
- Convert natural language to structured commands
- "analyze this project" → /analyze .
- "what files are in src/" → /ls src/
- "show me the git status" → /git status
- Support intent recognition and parameter extraction
- Provide command suggestions for unclear inputs

**5. Auto-completion & Suggestions**
- Intelligent command completion for slash commands
- File path auto-completion for all file operations
- Context-aware suggestions based on current project
- Command history search and re-execution
- Smart error correction for typos and partial commands

### Phase 3C: Enhanced User Experience

**6. Rich Console Interface**
- Enhanced console with rich formatting using Rich library
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks and files
- Interactive file previews and project tree display
- Progress indicators for long-running operations
- Tabular data display for analysis results

**7. Project Context Awareness**
- Automatic project type detection (Python, Node.js, etc.)
- Load relevant files and configuration automatically
- Monitor file changes for real-time context updates
- Generate intelligent project summaries
- Git repository awareness and status integration

### Phase 3D: Advanced Features

**8. Session Management**
- Persistent conversation history across sessions
- Named conversation sessions for different projects
- Context switching between multiple projects
- Export/import conversations in standard formats
- Session cleanup and archival management

**9. Advanced Integrations**
- Deep Git repository analysis and workflow integration
- Package.json/requirements.txt dependency awareness
- IDE integration hooks for external tool communication
- CI/CD pipeline integration for deployment workflows
- File system monitoring for automatic context updates

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ConversationManager**: Session memory and context persistence
2. **SlashCommandProcessor**: Claude-style command parsing and execution
3. **IntelligentRouter**: Task-appropriate provider selection
4. **ProjectContextLoader**: Automatic file and workspace awareness
5. **NLCommandParser**: Natural language to command conversion
6. **RichConsole**: Enhanced UI with formatting and interactivity

### Integration Points

- Existing smart_ai_backend.py for provider communication
- TaskMaster MCP integration for task management
- Git repositories for version control awareness
- File system for project context and monitoring
- Rich library for enhanced terminal output

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Must Have)
1. Slash commands - Core Claude-style interaction patterns
2. Conversation memory - Context retention across sessions  
3. Project awareness - Automatic file and git context loading
4. Intelligent routing - Route queries to optimal AI provider

### Medium Priority (Should Have)
1. Rich formatting - Enhanced output display and visualization
2. Auto-completion - Command and file path suggestions
3. Natural language parsing - Convert prose to structured commands
4. Session management - Save and load conversation sessions

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)  
1. Advanced integrations - IDE hooks and CI/CD connectivity
2. Voice commands - Speech-to-text integration support
3. Plugin system - Custom slash command development
4. Team collaboration - Shared conversation capabilities

## User Stories

### Story 1: Project Analysis
**As a developer**, I want to analyze my project by typing "/analyze" and get contextual insights about my codebase, dependencies, and potential issues without manually specifying file paths.

### Story 2: Conversational Context
**As a developer**, I want the AI to remember our previous conversation when I ask follow-up questions like "what about the security issues?" without repeating context.

### Story 3: Command Discovery
**As a new user**, I want to type "/help" and see available commands with examples relevant to my current project type and files.

### Story 4: File Operations
**As a developer**, I want to ask "show me main.py" and have the AI display the file with syntax highlighting and offer relevant suggestions for improvements.

### Story 5: Smart Routing
**As a user**, I want the AI to automatically choose the best provider for my question - using TreeQuest for code analysis and Claude for general discussion.

## Success Criteria

- All slash commands functional with comprehensive help
- Conversation context maintained across sessions consistently  
- Intelligent provider routing working with 90% accuracy
- Project context automatically detected and loaded
- Rich output formatting implemented with syntax highlighting
- Auto-completion working for commands and file paths
- Comprehensive test coverage above 80%
- Performance benchmarks met (<500ms startup, <2s responses)
- User documentation complete with examples

## Dependencies

- Rich library for enhanced terminal UI
- Prompt-toolkit for advanced input handling
- Watchdog for file system monitoring
- GitPython for repository integration
- Existing smart-ai backend and provider ecosystem
- TaskMaster MCP integration for task automation

## Timeline

**Week 1-2**: Core Infrastructure (ConversationManager, SlashCommandProcessor, IntelligentRouter)
**Week 3-4**: Command Interface (NLCommandParser, Auto-completion)  
**Week 5-6**: Enhanced UX (RichConsole, ProjectContextLoader)
**Week 7-8**: Advanced Features (SessionManagement, Advanced Integrations)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Complexity Risk**: Break implementation into small, testable components
- **Performance Risk**: Implement lazy loading and efficient context management
- **Integration Risk**: Maintain backward compatibility with existing smart-ai backend
- **User Adoption Risk**: Provide comprehensive documentation and smooth migration path
